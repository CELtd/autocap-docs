# Welcome to Autocap

Welcome to the AutoCap documentation.

AutoCap is an automatic DataCap allocator that enables Storage Providers to access Filecoin Plus (FIL+) DataCap through a transparent, automated, and activity-based process. DataCap is allocated based on verifiable on-chain economic activity, removing the need for manual applications or subjective approval processes.
