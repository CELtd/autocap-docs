# Welcome to Autocap

At [CryptoEconLab](https://cryptoeconlab.com/), we've built [**Autocap**](https://filautocap.xyz/), a system that enables Storage Providers to access [Filecoin Plus (FIL+)](https://fil.org/filecoin-plus) DataCap through a transparent, automated, and activity-based process.

Autocap allocates DataCap (DC) based on **verifiable on-chain economic activity**, removing the need for manual applications or subjective approval processes.
