# Welcome to Autocap

At [CryptoEconLab](https://cryptoeconlab.com/), we've built [**AutoCap**](https://filautocap.xyz/), a system that enables Storage Providers to access Filecoin Plus (FIL+) DataCap through a transparent, automated, and activity-based process.

AutoCap allocates DataCap based on **verifiable on-chain economic activity**, removing the need for manual applications or subjective approval processes.
