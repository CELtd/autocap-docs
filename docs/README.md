# Welcome to Autocap

At [CryptoEconLab](https://cryptoeconlab.com/), we've built [**Autocap**](https://filautocap.xyz/), an automatic DataCap allocator for the [Filecoin Plus (FIL+)](https://fil.org/filecoin-plus) program.

Autocap enables participants to earn DataCap through a transparent, automated, and activity-based process. Instead of relying on manual applications or discretionary approval, Autocap distributes DataCap based on **verifiable on-chain economic activity**.

By grounding allocation in observable behavior rather than prior permission, Autocap introduces a rule-driven mechanism for FIL+ participation, one where DataCap is earned as a consequence of contribution to the network, and allocation outcomes are reproducible, auditable, and proportional by design.
