# Who is Autocap For?

AutoCap is designed for **Storage Providers** who generate real economic activity on Filecoin and want a transparent, automated path to accessing Filecoin Plus (FIL+) DataCap.

In particular, AutoCap is well-suited for Storage Providers who:

* Provide services that generate **economic activity via Filecoin Pay**
* **Want transparent, automated access to DC** based on verifiable on-chain behavior
* Prefer a competitive, rule-based allocation mechanism over manual applications

By offering services that settle through Filecoin Pay, including, but not limited to, storage-related workflows, participants can:

* Generate on-chain economic activity measurable by AutoCap
* Earn DataCap allocations through AutoCap rounds
* Use the allocated DataCap to make verified storage deals under the Filecoin Plus program

Participation in AutoCap is **entirely optional** and does not affect access to DataCap through existing Filecoin Plus allocators and processes.

AutoCap does not replace the current FIL+ model. Instead, it introduces an **additional access path** based on an _action-first, reward-later_ approach, where allocation follows demonstrated contribution rather than prior approval.
