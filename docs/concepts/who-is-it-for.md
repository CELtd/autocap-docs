# Who is Autocap For?

Autocap is designed for **Storage Providers** who:

* Provide services that generate **economic activity via Filecoin Pay**
* Want transparent, automated access to DC based on verifiable on-chain behavior
* Prefer a competitive, rule-based allocation mechanism over manual applications

By providing services through Filecoin Pay  (including storage-related workflows) Storage Providers can:

* Generate on-chain economic activity;
* Earn DC allocations via Autocap;
* Subsequently, use that DC to make verified storage deals.

Autocap is **optional**. Storage Providers may continue to access DC through existing Filecoin Plus channels. Autocap only introduces an additional path based on an **action-first, reward-later** model.
