# Who is AutoCap For?

AutoCap is designed for **Storage Providers** who:

* Provide services that generate **economic activity via Filecoin Pay**
* Want transparent, automated access to DataCap based on verifiable on-chain behavior
* Prefer a competitive, rule-based allocation mechanism over manual applications

By providing services through Filecoin Pay — including storage-related workflows — Storage Providers can simultaneously:

* Generate on-chain economic activity
* Earn DataCap allocations via AutoCap
* Use that DataCap to make verified storage deals

AutoCap is **optional**. Storage Providers may continue to access DataCap through existing Filecoin Plus channels. AutoCap introduces an additional path based on an **action-first, reward-later** model.
