# Why FIL Burns?

FIL burns provide a **protocol-native, verifiable signal of economic activity** on the Filecoin network.

When FIL is burned as part of Filecoin Pay settlement:

* The event is recorded on-chain
* It is irreversible and cannot be faked
* It reflects finalized economic usage of Filecoin services

By tying DataCap allocation to FIL burns, AutoCap uses a **neutral and objective proxy for value**, avoiding subjective evaluation or intent-based signaling.
