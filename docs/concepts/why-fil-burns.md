# Why FIL Burns?

FIL burns provide a **protocol-native and verifiable signal of economic activity** on the Filecoin network.

When FIL is burned as part of a Filecoin Pay settlement, the event is recorded on-chain, finalized, and irreversible. It cannot be faked, reversed, or replayed, and it reflects economic usage that has actually been realized rather than merely planned or signaled.

Because FIL is burned only at settlement, it captures activity that has completed its full lifecycle: obligations have accrued, services have been delivered, and payment has been finalized. This makes FIL burns a reliable indicator of completed economic activity.

By tying DataCap allocation to FIL burns, Autocap relies on a **neutral and objective proxy for value**. Allocation decisions do not depend on intent, metadata, or off-chain interpretation, and do not require subjective evaluation of services or participants. Instead, they are derived directly from observable on-chain outcomes.
