# After the Round Closes

Once the round ends:

1. Eligible FIL burns are counted;
2.  DC allocations are computed deterministically based on the round’s formula:

    $$
    \text{Your DC Allocation} = (\text{Your \ FIL \ Burned in Round / Total FIL Burned in  Round})
    × \text{Round's Total DC}
    $$
3. Final allocation results are published on the dashboard;
4. DC is issued to the **DataCap Actor ID** specified during registration;
