# After the Round Closes

Once the round ends:

1. Eligible FIL burns are finalized and aggregated
2. DataCap allocations are computed deterministically based on the round’s formula
3. Final allocation results are published on the dashboard
4. DataCap is issued to the **DataCap Actor ID** specified during registration

> Note: The exact timing and on-chain execution mechanism for DataCap issuance is under active development and will be documented prior to mainnet deployment.
