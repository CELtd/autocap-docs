# Before the Round Starts

Before a round opens, ensure you have the following:

1. A **Filecoin-compatible wallet** capable of interacting with the Filecoin Mainnet;
2. Sufficient **FIL** to cover the round’s registration fee;
3. Your **DataCap Actor ID** (`f0xxx`) where any allocated DataCap should be sent.

> Note: The wallet used during registration becomes your **Participant Address** and is the only address whose Filecoin Pay settlement activity will be tracked for the round.
