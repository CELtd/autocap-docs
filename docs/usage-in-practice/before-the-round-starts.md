# Before the Round Starts

Before a round opens, ensure you have the following:

1. A **Filecoin-compatible wallet** capable of interacting with the Filecoin Mainnet;
2. Sufficient **FIL** to cover the round’s registration fee;
3. Your **DataCap Recipient Address** where any allocated DataCap should be sent.

{% hint style="info" %}
The wallet connected during registration becomes your **Burn Address** and is the only address whose Filecoin Pay settlement activity will be tracked for the round.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The **DataCap Recipient Address** is in the form of **Filecoin's Actor ID** (`f0xxx`). However, during the registration for the round, it can be provided as a standard wallet address `f1, f2, f3, f4, 0x` since AutoCap automatically derives the correct address. You can check your Actor ID at [https://filecoin.blockscout.com/](https://filecoin.blockscout.com/)
