# During the Round

During the active round window:

1. Generate FIL burns by using **Filecoin Pay** from your registered Participant Address
2. Ensure that activity results in **finalized Filecoin Pay settlements denominated in FIL**
3. Monitor the [Autocap Dashboard](https://filautocap.xyz/) to:
   * Observe eligible FIL burns as settlements finalize;
   * Track your provisional share of the DC pool;
   * Compare activity relative to other participants.

Autocap does not prescribe specific services, counterparties, or workflows. Participants are responsible for ensuring that their Filecoin Pay usage complies with protocol requirements and results in eligible settlement burns.
