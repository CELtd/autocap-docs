When a round opens, Storage Providers can register through the AutoCap Dashboard by:

- Connecting a Filecoin-compatible wallet
  *(this wallet becomes the **Participant Address** tracked for on-chain activity)*
- Paying the registration fee from that wallet
- Providing a **DataCap Actor ID** (`f0xxx`) where any allocated DataCap will be sent

Registration establishes the binding between measured on-chain activity and the DataCap recipient for the round.

**Important:** Registration defines two distinct address roles:

- **Participant Address (wallet address)**
  This is the address from which **on-chain activity is measured**.
  Only activity originating from this address is counted toward the round.

- **DataCap Actor ID (`f0xxx`)**
  This is the address that receives the DataCap allocation at the end of the round.
  It is not used for activity measurement.

Each Participant Address may register **at most once per round**.
