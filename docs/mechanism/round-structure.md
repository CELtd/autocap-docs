### Round Structure

Rounds are independent from one another. Activity in one round does not carry over to the next, and participants must explicitly register for each round they wish to participate in.

This design ensures:
- Clear accounting boundaries
- Deterministic allocation outcomes
- No retroactive effects across rounds
