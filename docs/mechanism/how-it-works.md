## How Does AutoCap Work?

AutoCap operates in **discrete allocation rounds**. Each round defines a self-contained accounting period during which economic activity is measured and DataCap is distributed.

Each round is parameterized by:
- A fixed **start time** and **end time**
- A **registration fee**, paid in FIL
- A fixed **total DataCap pool** to be allocated at the end of the round

The round lifecycle consists of four phases: registration, activity measurement, allocation calculation, and distribution.
