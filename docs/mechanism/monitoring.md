# Monitoring and Transparency

Monitoring is available throughout all phases of a round through a real-time [dashboard](https://filautocap.xyz/) that allows participants to:

* View upcoming, active, and past rounds
* See registered participants for each round
* Track **eligible FIL burns** as settlements are finalized on-chain
* View expected DataCap allocations (updated as new settlements occur)
* Verify registration status and associated addresses

The dashboard links the participant addresses to [https://pay.filecoin.cloud](https://pay.filecoin.cloud/), where all Filecoin Pay settlements and resulting FIL burns can be independently verified.
