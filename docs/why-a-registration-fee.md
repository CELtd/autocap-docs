# Why a Registration Fee?

Registration fees do **not** count toward a participant’s eligible FIL burn for DataCap allocation.

Their purpose is purely structural. The registration fee exists to:

* Prevent spam or costless registrations
* Ensure a minimal economic commitment from participants
* Maintain a clean separation between **access control** and **contribution measurement**
* Cover the transaction costs associated with issuing DataCap allocations at the end of the round

By excluding the registration fee from contribution accounting, Autocap ensures that allocation outcomes are driven exclusively by **measured on-chain economic activity**, rather than by participation overhead or gating mechanisms.

This separation preserves the integrity of the allocation process: registration controls _who_ can participate in a round, while FIL burns determine _how much_ DataCap is allocated.
